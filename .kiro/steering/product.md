# Auto Copilot Context

## Product Overview
Auto Copilot Context is a VS Code extension that automatically collects and organizes context from opened files and tabs to provide AI programming assistants with relevant project information. The extension monitors which files you have open and generates structured context files that can be consumed by various AI coding assistants.

## Core Concept
The extension transforms your development behavior into intelligent context rules by monitoring opened tabs and files, then generating appropriate context files in formats compatible with different AI assistants.

## Key Features
- Automatic context collection from opened tabs and files
- Smart filtering of irrelevant files (respects .gitignore)
- Multiple output formats for different AI assistants (Cursor, Roo, Cline)
- Window and workspace-level context management
- Configurable output formats and paths
- Support for multi-workspace environments

## Use Cases
- Helping new team members understand project architecture
- Providing focused context during feature development
- Supplying complete context for bug fixing
- Enabling AI assistants to have the right context for code generation

## Target Users
Developers who use AI coding assistants and want to improve the quality of AI-generated code by providing better context about their project structure and current development focus.
